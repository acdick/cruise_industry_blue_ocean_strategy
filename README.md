BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE & GROWTH STRATEGY
# Scenario Planning for the 2035 Cruise Industry
A BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY TO CREATE NEW MARKET SPACE

Although the cruise industry has experienced high growth in recent years, consumer segmentation and industry concentration suggest that the long tail of the market may be underserved. Cruise lines can respond by driving business model innovation via Blue Ocean Strategy to identify white space market opportunities and create value innovation. The long-term strategic cycle of the cruise industry can be accommodated by envisioning contrasting future scenarios in which present-day business decisions will be executed. This work generates actionable options that cruise lines may adopt to maintain steady growth through 2035 via scenario planning and option planning. The business model of a mass market cruise line is first mapped in a causality tree and a value cycle to visualize key performance indicators across financial, customer, internal and learning objectives. Qualitative market research is subsequently conducted through interviews with industry experts and consumers to define consumer personas, identify impactful macro-trends and evaluate customer satisfaction. Next, morphological vectors of macro-trends are arranged to construct plausible and consistent future scenarios with narratives, implications and warning signals. Finally, a set of portfolio options is created using the Four Actions Framework and Strategy Canvas to explore business model innovation via customer impact, value proposition impact and cost impact.

## Option Planning
BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY | VALUE INNOVATION | FOUR ACTIONS FRAMEWORK | STRATEGY CANVAS | PORTFOLIO REVIEW

Strategic options for the cruise industry were formulated by:
- [x] Developing strategic direction to target white space market opportunities with Blue Ocean Strategy via value innovation
- [x] Creating an option set by reshaping the business model of mass market cruise lines with the Four Actions Framework
- [x] Evaluating options against each other by comparing their properties using the Strategy Canvas

1. **Strategic Direction**<br>
   Scenario planning can be applied to strategic thinking by adopting either:
   * An internal perspective, reviewing the ability of an organization to survive with existing capabilities in future environments
   * An external perspective, reviewing opportunities to develop the business portfolio of an organization in emergent future territories
   
   Blue Ocean Strategy seeks to create and capture uncontested market space, referred to as blue oceans, through value innovation, which is achieved by simultaneously:
   * Differentiating value proposition for buyers
   * improving cost structure

2. **Option Set**<br>
   Business model innovation can be driven from three perspectives, namely:
   * Exploration by customer impact
   * Exploration by value proposition impact
   * Exploration by cost impact

## Conclusions
The critical elements of this strategic framework are presented in:
- [x] Key research findings
- [x] Strategic industry recommendations
- [x] Research limitations and opportunities for future work

1. **Key Findings**<br>
   1. The current business model of mass market cruise lines is governed by three virtuous cycles, which are:
      * The growth cycle, connecting new ships, high passenger volume and high ship utilization
      * The subsidy cycle, driving low fares, high onboard sales and high ticket subsidies
      * The investment cycle, interlinking low fares, high onboard sales and high net income
   2. The impactful factors of the cruise industry are:
      * Cxcess passenger demand and undersupply of cruise ships
      * Access to low-cost international labor markets
      * Scarcity of experienced cruise designers and shipbuilders
      * High waterfront utilization and operational bottlenecks
   3. The financial goals of cruise lines are:
      * Optimization of operational cost structures to increase revenue yield
      * Reduction of variable costs via investments in long-term revenue-generating fixed cost assets
      * Reliance on local communities to redevelop dilapidated waterfront infrastructure
   4. The consumer value proposition of cruise lines offers all-inclusive experiences, however, there are opportunities to:
      * Specialize in curated travel
      * Connect with nature through small boats
   5. The internal processes of cruise lines rely on:
      * High-quality human capital, including service, maritime and design staff
      * Attention to marine logistics, guided by a crew safety culture
   6. Learning and growth of cruise lines can be facilitated through:
      * Fragmentation of consumer demand
      * Technological innovation driven by high-speed boat designs
      * Personalization of passenger experiences with the local knowledge of professional maritime crews
   7. Consumer personas go on cruises:
      * With a spouse or partner (24%), friends or acquaintances (18%) or parents or grandparents (14%)
      <p align="center">

2. **Strategic Recommendations**<br>
   Three actionable options respond to the four future scenarios created from these uncertainties:
   1. The existing business model of mass market cruise lines responds to the continued growth scenario in “Out Tonight,” which envisions affordable itineraries and crowded destinations. Consequently, consumers desire fun and exciting activities that they cannot experience in their homes or daily routines. The existing business model offers novel experiences through:
      * A variety of mega-ships
      * All-inclusive entertainment
      * Affordable itineraries to international destinations
   2. The option for “Hub-and-Spoke Ecotourism” responds to the steady state scenario in “What You Own,” which imagines affordable itineraries and spacious destinations. Consumers are experienced and savvy globetrotters who are sophisticated and generationally-responsible. This option offers multi-day stopover itineraries from major ports of call to the growing number of nearby ecotourism port destinations, focusing on:
       * Sustainability
       * Intimate ships
       * Personalization
   3. The option for “Community Mega-Events” responds to the transformational scenario in “Rent,” in which the future is described by expensive itineraries and spacious destinations. Large portions of the population work remotely in micro-hubs of nearby mega-cities, who are attracted to virtual and augmented reality technology in digital tourism. This option focuses on:
       * The collective belonging to community
       * Immersive cultural experiences
       * Large-scale convention events
   4. The option for “Maritime Digital Nomads” responds to the total collapse scenario in “On the Street,” which results in expensive itineraries and crowded destinations. Through financial shock events and growing inequality, consumers are concentrated in mega-cities with little disposable income. This option offers long-term residential leases and collaborative office spaces to remote workers, known as digital nomads, delivering:
       * Affordability
       * Workspaces
       * Reliability

3. **Limitations and Future Work**<br>
   The completeness of this research is limited due to its academic nature with a sole researcher:
   * Scenario planning is most effective with multiple team members contributing diverse knowledge
   * Research partnerships with industry experts improve business modeling and assumed implications
   * A sole researcher is constrained by bounded rationality, myopic perception and personal bias
   
   Opportunities for this research to be enriched include scenario development and option validation:
   * Developmental scenarios can be investigated for duopolistic markets with concentrated power
   * Contextual and transactional trends could be quantitatively analyzed with probabilistic methods
   * Strategic options can be validated via stakeholder testing, market research and prototyping
